# 🎮 Centipede Game (Semester 1 Project)

> _"Maybe I wasn’t very fond of this project at first, but looking back now — for a girl with no computer background — this was something to celebrate."_  
>  
> This was my very first programming project during Semester 1. I still remember how overwhelmed I felt when the project was assigned. With just a basic understanding of loops and arrays, I had no idea how I'd even make a centipede move across the screen.  
>  
> But slowly, with trial and error, I figured things out. And while the game might not be perfect — missing features like centipede splitting or some edge cases — I completed it. And that was a huge step in my learning journey.
